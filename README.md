# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more. Using machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a model that helps in early diagnosis of diabetes, potentially assisting in preventive healthcare.
